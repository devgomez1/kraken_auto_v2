# Suggested Development Order

1. **Project Initialization and Environment Setup**  
   - Create the project directory structure as outlined.  
   - Set up a Python virtual environment.  
   - Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

2. **Configuration and Logging Setup**  
   - Populate `config/config.yml` with basic parameters (trading pairs, timeframes, etc.).  
   - Copy `credentials_example.yml` to a secure `credentials.yml` for your API keys (do not commit this file).  
   - Configure `logging.ini` to establish logging formats and levels.

3. **Data Acquisition and Loading**  
   - Download historical market data and store it in `data/historical_data/`.  
   - Implement `src/utils/data_loader.py` to load and preprocess historical data for backtesting.

4. **Exchange Integration**  
   - Develop `src/exchanges/kraken_client.py` to interact with the Kraken API (fetch balances, order books, etc.).  
   - Write initial tests in `tests/test_exchange_client.py` to verify correct exchange interactions.

5. **Base Strategy Interface**  
   - Define `BaseStrategy` in `src/strategies/base_strategy.py` to standardize methods like `generate_signals()`.

6. **Strategy Implementation**  
   - Implement a basic strategy in `src/strategies/my_strategy.py`.  
   - Add tests in `tests/test_strategy.py` to ensure it produces expected signals under known conditions.

7. **Backtesting Framework**  
   - Implement `src/backtesting/backtester.py` to simulate your strategy using historical data.  
   - Run backtests, analyze performance, and refine your strategy logic.

8. **Paper Trading Bot**  
   - Develop `src/bots/paper_trading_bot.py` to simulate trading in real-time with virtual funds.  
   - Implement `src/utils/trade_execution.py` to handle simulated order fills, slippage, and P/L tracking.  
   - Store results in `data/paper_trading_results/` and review to confirm strategy performance in real-time conditions.

9. **Logging and Monitoring Enhancements**  
   - Use `src/utils/logger.py` to ensure consistent logging.  
   - Regularly review logs in `data/logs/` for debugging and performance monitoring.

10. **Integration Testing**  
    - Write integration tests in `tests/` to ensure strategies, the exchange client, and utilities work smoothly together.  
    - Confirm that backtesting and paper trading produce consistent results under test conditions.

11. **Command-Line Interface and main.py**  
    - Implement logic in `src/main.py` to run different modes:
      - `python src/main.py --mode=backtest --strategy=my_strategy`
      - `python src/main.py --mode=paper`
      - `python src/main.py --mode=live`

12. **Live Trading Bot**  
    - After validating performance in backtesting and paper trading, implement `src/bots/live_trading_bot.py`.  
    - Begin with small position sizes and closely monitor performance.

13. **Refinements and Scaling**  
    - Fine-tune strategy parameters based on live results.  
    - Add more strategies in `src/strategies/` and test them thoroughly.  
    - Incorporate advanced features (risk management, multiple timeframes, etc.) as needed.

14. **Documentation and Maintenance**  
    - Update `README.md` with setup instructions, usage details, and strategy descriptions.  
    - Maintain and expand unit tests to ensure continued reliability as the project grows.

**By following this order, you ensure that you build a robust, well-tested system before risking real funds, making it easier to troubleshoot and refine strategies as you go.**
