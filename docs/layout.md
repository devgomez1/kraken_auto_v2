## Directories and Files

### `config/` Directory

- **config.yml**  
  Holds general runtime configuration (e.g., trading pairs, timeframes, position sizing, and strategy parameters).  
  **Why it’s good:** Centralizing configuration values makes it easy to adjust settings without modifying code. It also simplifies environment-specific changes.

- **credentials_example.yml**  
  A template for storing sensitive credentials (API keys, secrets). The real credentials file should be kept out of version control.  
  **Why it’s good:** Protects sensitive information and provides a clear template for onboarding new team members.

- **logging.ini**  
  Defines logging levels, formats, and output destinations.  
  **Why it’s good:** Standardizes logging across all modules, simplifying debugging and ensuring consistent log formatting.

### `data/` Directory

- **historical_data/**  
  Stores raw or processed historical OHLC data for backtesting.  
  **Why it’s good:** Separates data from code, making it easier to maintain and update datasets independently.

- **paper_trading_results/**  
  Holds results, performance metrics, and logs from paper trading sessions.  
  **Why it’s good:** Keeps simulation outputs organized for analysis and review without cluttering code directories.

- **logs/**  
  Centralized storage for runtime logs from bots, backtests, and utilities.  
  **Why it’s good:** Makes troubleshooting more efficient by keeping all logs in one easy-to-find location.

### `src/` Directory

This directory contains all the main code organized by functionality.

#### `exchanges/`
- **kraken_client.py**  
  Contains functions to interact with the Kraken API (e.g., get order book, place orders, fetch balances).  
  **Why it’s good:** Isolates exchange-specific logic, making it easy to update or swap exchanges in the future.

#### `strategies/`
- **base_strategy.py**  
  Defines a base class/interface that all strategies must implement (e.g., methods for generating signals).  
  **Why it’s good:** Enforces a consistent interface for strategies, enabling easy switching and comparison.

- **my_strategy.py**  
  Contains a specific trading strategy’s logic (e.g., indicators, entry/exit signals, stop losses).  
  **Why it’s good:** Isolating strategies simplifies testing, iteration, and adding new strategies without affecting the rest of the code.

#### `backtesting/`
- **backtester.py**  
  Runs historical simulations of strategies using historical data. May integrate with libraries like Backtrader.  
  **Why it’s good:** Allows thorough testing of strategies before any real or simulated trading, minimizing risk.

#### `bots/`
- **paper_trading_bot.py**  
  Simulates live trading with real-time price feeds but uses virtual funds (no real money involved). Tracks hypothetical P/L, positions, and orders.  
  **Why it’s good:** Provides a realistic environment to test strategies in real-time conditions safely.

- **live_trading_bot.py**  
  Executes real trades on Kraken after successful backtesting and paper trading. Uses the same signals as the paper bot but with real credentials.  
  **Why it’s good:** Reduces the risk of live trading since you only move forward after validating strategies and logic.

#### `utils/`
- **data_loader.py**  
  Handles data loading and preprocessing (e.g., from CSVs or APIs) for backtesting.  
  **Why it’s good:** Centralizing data operations promotes clean code and reuse across modules.

- **logger.py**  
  Configures and provides a standardized logger object for the entire codebase.  
  **Why it’s good:** Ensures consistent logging and simplifies making logging-related changes in one place.

- **trade_execution.py**  
  Contains utility functions for simulating order fills, calculating slippage, commissions, and possibly abstracting real order placement logic.  
  **Why it’s good:** By centralizing execution logic, changes to order handling propagate seamlessly throughout the system.

#### `main.py`
- **main.py**  
  The primary entry point for running different modes of the bot:
  - `python src/main.py --mode=backtest --strategy=my_strategy`
  - `python src/main.py --mode=paper`
  - `python src/main.py --mode=live`  
  **Why it’s good:** Provides a single, clear point of execution, making it straightforward for users and developers to start the system in any mode.

### `tests/` Directory

- **test_strategy.py**, **test_exchange_client.py**, **test_backtester.py**, **test_utils.py**  
  Contains unit tests that verify each component’s behavior under expected conditions.  
  **Why it’s good:** Automated testing ensures reliability, simplifies debugging, and provides confidence when making changes or adding features.

### Other Files

- **requirements.txt**  
  Lists Python dependencies (e.g., `pandas`, `ccxt`, `backtrader`).  
  **Why it’s good:** Makes it easy to install and reproduce the environment, ensuring consistency across different machines.

- **README.md**  
  Explains how to install dependencies, run the bot, perform backtests, paper trade, and configure credentials/logging.  
  **Why it’s good:** A clear README helps new contributors and users quickly get started and understand the project’s capabilities.

## Overall Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns:** Each part of the codebase has a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.  
- **Scalability & Flexibility:** You can easily add new strategies, integrate additional exchanges, or adjust workflows without restructuring the entire project.  
- **Testing & Reliability:** Clear boundaries between components make it simpler to write and run unit tests, ensuring that issues are caught early.  
- **Maintainability:** A predictable and logical structure means that new contributors or future iterations can pick up where you left off without confusion.

By following this structure, you establish a solid foundation to build upon, allowing you to focus on improving strategies and execution rather than managing complex or disorganized code.
